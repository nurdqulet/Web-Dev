I like learning new things.<br>
Sometimes it is hard.<br>
<strong>But I do not give up.</strong><br>
I read, I try, I practice.<br>
<em>Mistakes help me learn.</em><br>
Every day I know more.<br>
Learning is a good thing.<br>
</p>

<p>
One simple idea:<br>
<strong>You can always improve.</strong>
