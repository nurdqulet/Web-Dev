        There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience the web.
        If you start from the idea that everyone wants a great online experience, then it makes sense that companies want Web Developers who can build that experience.
        More websites and more users means more demand, and that demand keeps growing.
